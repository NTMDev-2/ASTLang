# ASTLang
A custom coding language that is fully functional, and based off of AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

Supports function definition, variable assignments, tuples, dictionaries and lists.

Current version: ASTLang 26, Pre-Alpha Release 2 [BETA]
Previous version was ASTLang 26, Pre-Alpha Release 1 [BETA]

Unsupported versions: ASTLang 25 and below (ASTLang 26 Pre-Release is also now unsupported as of September 28th)

NOTE: Problems with a final comment by NTMDev (me) shows that the problem was fixed. I keep problems open for easier reference.
Bonus: ASTLang comes with a simple vector creator and simulator
